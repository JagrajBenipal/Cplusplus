The Child and Toy has the composition relationship where the Child class has an array of toy class. When it is destroyed, it destroys the Toy array as well. For ConfirmOrder and Toy, they have the aggregation relationship. Although the ConfirmOrder has an array of Toy, it couldnâ€™t destroy the Toy member, as it can only switch the pointer to nullptr.
