I've learned how to apply templates to classes and about the inheritance of class templates through this workshop.
In order to generate classes based on the data type, I primarily used a class template. However, a function template is different from a class template in that it still works even if template arguments aren't explicitly written. But because in the process of constructing an object , we should include it in the class template.
I created an equal operator to determine whether two objects are different Pair objects and an insertion operator to display objects of the Pair type.
The add function's job in the Set module is to store unique data in memory while avoiding repeated values.
When two values in a specialized template are double and their absolute difference is less than or equal to 0.01 we treat them as the same value.
